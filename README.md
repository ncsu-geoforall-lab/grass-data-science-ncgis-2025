# Geospatial Data Science with GRASS (NC GIS 2025)

This hands-on NCGIS 2025 pre-conference workshop introduces participants to GRASS GIS as a powerful geospatial processing engine integrated with Python for advanced data science workflows.

Using online Jupyter notebooks, participants will explore how GRASS GIS tools can handle large datasets, automate spatial analysis using Python, and perform complex computations.

Participants will work through examples of raster and vector processing, spatial statistics, and image classification. No previous experience with GRASS GIS is required, but either basic Python or advanced geospatial experience is recommended.

Type: Hands-on

Duration: 4 hours

Presenter: Vaclav (Vashek) Petras
